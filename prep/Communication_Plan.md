## Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

-Remo and Zoom for virtual collaboration
-Slack for verbal messaging
-We have agreed we all feel comfortable having a conversation regarding if we don’t feel heard to start by asking for other group members to listen to us on a particular topic. We all will put in an effort to have a mutual awareness to make sure no one is being excluded
-During stand-ups we will have a well-being check-in for everyone. 

Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
-	Frustration will be inevitable with coding, however, if we feel it becomes personal, we will proactively address it.
-	If someone feels like there is a conflict, we agree to try to speak with the other group member in question, or another group member to try to resolve it.
-	We will also take a 5-10 minute break to reflect so parties can think about how the other might feel.
-	If both of these approaches fail, we will agree to ask a TA or Nicholas to help arbitrate
-	Group of three when it comes to coding disagreements majority will decide
Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. What project management tool will be used?
-	We will use Trello for task-managing
-	We will try our best to spread out work evenly from the start and reassess at stand-ups and throughout the day to make sure everyone has something important to work on
-	When setting up original server, create empty callback functions to prevent any merge conflicts i.e. help map out server from the start as much as possible. 
-	We will stick to our current schedule of starting at 9am, lunch breaks at 12pm, and aiming to finish between 4-5pm when possible. We will take 10-15 minute breaks every hour to hour and half as needed

Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
-	Main branch (final)  Dev branch (compiled work that has been reviewed)  Individual branches for specific features
-	Pull requests will be walked through and explained by the developer and reviewed by the other members before merges. Afterwards everyone will pull the dev branch back down
-	We will try to establish clear lanes of work and if we know they will intersect we will try to keep an open dialogue on what might be affected while we code.
Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times (outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc.
-	We will communicate our respective time restrictions
-	Work over break is allowed but will be communicated clearly and reviewed after the break by all team members
-	Work after hours must be communicated clearly to team members before the breaking for the day
-	Stand-up after lunch and at the end of the day.
-	Ask for help when needed, if it is a small task we will help at time of asking if it is larger we will pick a good stopping time for our respective work to help our group mate.
